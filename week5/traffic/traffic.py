def load_data(data_dir):
    """
    Load image data from directory `data_dir`.

    Assume `data_dir` has one directory named after each category, numbered
    0 through NUM_CATEGORIES - 1. Inside each category directory will be some
    number of image files.

    Return tuple `(images, labels)`. `images` should be a list of all
    of the images in the data directory, where each image is formatted as a
    numpy ndarray with dimensions IMG_WIDTH x IMG_HEIGHT x 3. `labels` should
    be a list of integer labels, representing the categories for each of the
    corresponding `images`.

    The load_data function should accept as an argument data_dir, representing the path to a directory where the data is stored, and return image arrays and labels for each image in the data set.
    You may assume that data_dir will contain one directory named after each category, numbered 0 through NUM_CATEGORIES - 1. Inside each category directory will be some number of image files.
    Use the OpenCV-Python module (cv2) to read each image as a numpy.ndarray (a numpy multidimensional array). To pass these images into a neural network, the images will need to be the same size, so be sure to resize each image to have width IMG_WIDTH and height IMG_HEIGHT.
    The function should return a tuple (images, labels). images should be a list of all of the images in the data set, where each image is represented as a numpy.ndarray of the appropriate size. labels should be a list of integers, representing the category number for each of the corresponding images in the images list.
    Your function should be platform-independent: that is to say, it should work regardless of operating system. Note that on macOS, the / character is used to separate path components, while the \ character is used on Windows. Use os.sep and os.path.join as needed instead of using your platformâ€™s specific separator character.

    The output layer of the neural network should have NUM_CATEGORIES units, one for each of the traffic sign categories.

    different numbers and sizes of hidden layers
